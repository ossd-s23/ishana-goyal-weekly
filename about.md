## About Me!

My name is Ishana Goyal. I am a senior here at NYU, studying Business (with a concentration in Finance) and Computer Science. 

I am originally from Sleepy Hollow, NY but have lived the majority of my life in West Windsor, NJ. 

### More Information

- I am the youngest of three siblings. 
- Though I was afraid of dogs for most of my life, 5 years ago my family decided to buy a dog and I have become a dog-lover ever since! My dog's name is Cece and she is a labradoodle. 
- In my free time, I enjoy running for leisure and experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. 
- Though I have not read any of the Harry Potter books, I have just begun watching the movie series. 
- I love playing board games (I grew up in a very competitive Monopoly family)! My current favorite is Catan. 
- One of my goals this semester is explore more restaurants in NYC so please let me know if you have recommendations!
